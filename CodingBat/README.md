This Java project is a demonstration of some of the most coding challenges in Java. These coding challenges are taken from Codingbat.com website.
The solutions of those challenges are posted here in this folder. However, I'd suggest to firstly go to the website and try solving
them, and then you can come here and compare the solution. Keep in mind, that in Java there are many ways to solve the problem, 
but the trick is to know how to choose the most efficient solution.
