//Write the class Bulb whose objects represent electric bulbs. 
//A light bulb can be turned on, off or broken, and provides only 
//two operations (methods): 
//	state () which returns a string indicating the current state of the bulb and 
//	click () which changes its state from on to off or off to on or breaks it. 
//	A light bulb breaks off after a certain number of clicks defined by the manufacturer. 
//	The class must contain:
//• One or more instance variables (attributes) that appropriately describe 
//the state of the bulb 
//• A suitable constructor
//• The methods expected (previsti)

//To test the class, write a TestLampadina program that creates an object of the 
//Bulb class that allows a maximum number of clicks decided by the user and then 
//iteratively offers the user the possibility to invoke one of the two functions 
//(displaying the outcome of the operation, in the case of state() ) or to terminate 
//the execution.
