// Challenge.
// Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class.
// Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
// You should be able to handle: steering, changing gears, and moving (change speed in other words).
// You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).
// As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
// For you specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car.
